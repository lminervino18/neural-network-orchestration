Connections between the Orchestrator and Workers

This distributed system consists of an Orchestrator and multiple Workers. Communication between these components is managed through a connection API, currently using the TCP protocol. The design is modular and can be easily extended to support other protocols such as UDP.

Connection Structure

Orchestrator:

- The Orchestrator manages Worker connections and coordinates tasks.
- It listens for incoming Worker connections on a specific port (e.g., 5000).
- When a Worker connects, the Orchestrator accepts the connection and assigns tasks to the Worker.

Workers:

- Workers are responsible for executing tasks assigned by the Orchestrator.
- Each Worker connects to the Orchestrator using the IP address and port where the Orchestrator is listening.
- After completing their tasks, Workers send the results back to the Orchestrator.

Connection API

Connection handling is abstracted in a common API that can be used for both TCP and UDP. This API defines the necessary functions for connecting, sending data, and receiving data between the Orchestrator and Workers.

Communication Trait (Defined in communication.rs)

The Communication trait provides a common interface for communication. It is implemented by TcpComm and UdpComm to handle connections using TCP and UDP, respectively.
